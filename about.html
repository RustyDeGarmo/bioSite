            <p>
                Gavin is the youngest of three siblings. He is the only boy. Because he’s only a boy, he doesn’t really have many notable accomplishments. He did survive open heart surgery when he was three years old though. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He had a congenital heart defect called <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/heartdefects/atrialseptaldefect.html" target="_blank">Atrial Septal Defect</a>. Essentially, there was a hole in his heart between the upper chambers. This in itself isn’t necessarily a problem, there is a flap of tissue that is supposed to seal this hole normally if it occurs. His tissue flap wasn’t big enough so they had to add some material to it. If left untreated, this defect could have shortened his lifespan by decades.
            </p>
            <p>
                He enjoys spending his free time playing video games (Fortnite), terrorizing the household with Nerf guns and RC cars, or spending time with animals. He has two dogs himself, an old Chocolate Lab named Chip and a young Chiweenie named Peanut. He also has two cats, but we’re not mentioning them.
            </p>
            <p>
                He and his sister made friends with one of the neighbors and got themselves a job walking her dogs five (5) days a week for $20 every two weeks. This is how he buys his Nerf guns and RC cars. He thinks it would be a good idea to save and invest his earnings, but he still isn’t committing to it despite his father running a <a href="https://trainfinance.com/" target="_blank">fledgling website about personal finance</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When he grows up he wants to work for NASA, Amazon, or be a Veterinarian. He wants to go to space for NASA, fulfill orders for Amazon, or take care of sick animals as a Veterinarian. I think it’s safe to say that he’s keeping his options open.
            </p>
            <p>
                His favorite subject in school is math. He says it’s easier than English and Science. So, perhaps he will follow in his old man’s footsteps and pursue software development. If he can ever come up with a way to earn a living by watching YouTube videos he’ll be set for life.
